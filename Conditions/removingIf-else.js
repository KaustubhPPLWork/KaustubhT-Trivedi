A simple scenario: Suppose Jon is waiting for the result of an exam, and he plans a vacation based on his exam score.
The exam result is divided into 4 rankings: A, B, C, and D:
If Jon gets an A, he rewards himself and goes for travel happily.
If Jon gets a B, the reward drops to normal shopping.
If Jon gets a C, he stays home and watches TV.
If Jon gets a D, heâ€™ll go to the library and work on the subject.
If we had to write a function to describe this behavior, what would you write?
