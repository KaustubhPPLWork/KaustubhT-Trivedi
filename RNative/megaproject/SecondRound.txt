The candidate was asked to create a new react project in which he had to render data that was fetched from an api
and then it was supposed to be rendered alphabetically in ascending order. Once the names were rendered, he had to 
style them with container first and content inside the container.


Didn't know how to use useEffect
Needed lots of hints and documentation references for finishing the assignment and still was not able to finish the assignment on own
Needed hints and help in CSS as well


Will not recommend for the next round
